## Interest Rates Stabilizing Creates Opportunities

After years of volatility, mortgage rates are showing signs of stabilization in 2025. Current rates hovering around 6.5-7% are creating a more predictable environment for both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions.

This stability is encouraging more inventory to hit the market as sellers who were "rate-locked" in their current homes are now more willing to move. Our platform data shows a 23% increase in new listings compared to this time last year.
