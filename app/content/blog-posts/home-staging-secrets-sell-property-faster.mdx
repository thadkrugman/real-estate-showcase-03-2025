## First Impressions Matter More Than Ever

In today's competitive market, buyers form opinions within the first 30 seconds of entering a home. Professional staging can increase your sale price by 6-10% while reducing time on market by an average of 38 days.

Our platform connects you with certified staging professionals and provides virtual staging options for online listings. Studies show that staged homes receive 40% more online views and generate more serious inquiries.

## DIY Staging Tips That Actually Work

Start with decluttering and deep cleaning â€“ these cost nothing but make the biggest impact. Remove personal items, family photos, and excess furniture to help buyers envision themselves in the space.

Focus on lighting and neutral colors. Open all curtains, add lamps to dark corners, and consider repainting bold walls in warm, neutral tones. Fresh flowers and subtle scents can create an welcoming atmosphere that buyers remember.
