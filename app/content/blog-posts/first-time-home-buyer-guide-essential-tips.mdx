## Get Your Finances in Order First

Before you start browsing listings, it's crucial to understand your financial position. Check your credit score, gather financial documents, and determine how much you can realistically afford. A good rule of thumb is to spend no more than 28% of your gross monthly income on housing costs.

Getting pre-approved for a mortgage gives you a clear budget and shows sellers you're serious. Our platform connects you with trusted lenders who can streamline this process, often getting you pre-approved within 24 hours.

## Research Neighborhoods Like a Pro

Location is everything in real estate. Use our advanced neighborhood analytics to explore crime rates, school ratings, commute times, and future development plans. Don't just visit during the day â€“ drive through potential neighborhoods at different times and days of the week.

Consider factors beyond the house itself: proximity to work, quality of schools, access to amenities, and resale potential. Our heat map feature shows you exactly how properties appreciate over time in different areas.

## Don't Skip the Home Inspection

A professional home inspection can save you thousands down the road. It reveals potential issues with plumbing, electrical, HVAC, and structural components that aren't visible during a casual walkthrough.

Our platform includes a network of certified inspectors and provides digital inspection reports with photos and priority rankings for any issues found. Remember, you can often negotiate repairs or price reductions based on inspection findings.
